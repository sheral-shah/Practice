point(50,80); //50,80 are to coordinates for the canvas
line(20,30,80,30); //20,20 are the coordinates for the beggining point and 80,30 for the ending point
rect(20,30,40,60); //20,30 are the cooordinates and 40,60 are the width and height of rectangle
//Other ways of creating a rectangle are:
rectMode (CENTER);
rect(20,30,40,60) //In the first code 20,30 was the left point of the rectangle. Here the rectangles will be created around the centre point which will be at 20,30
rectMODE (CORNERS);
rect (40,40,60,60) //Specify coordinates of the upper left and lower right corners
ellipse(20,20,40,40) //20,20 are coordinates 40,40 width and height
ellipseMode (CENTRE);
ellipse(20,20,40,40) //ellipse of size 40,40 will be centred around the coordinate 20,20
ellipseMode (CORNER);
ellipse (20,20,40,40) //20,20 are the upper left cordinates
ellipseMode (CORNERS);
ellipse (20,20,40,40) //20,20 and 40,40 are the upper left and lower right cooordinates
